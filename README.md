# Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) – House Prices Dataset

## Overview
In this assignment, Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) techniques were applied to a real estate dataset.  
The goal is to understand the structure of the data, discover patterns, and identify factors that may influence house prices.

## Dataset
The dataset contains information about properties such as:
- Location
- Price (in rupees)
- Carpet area
- Number of bathrooms
- Furnishing status
- Ownership
- Transaction type
and other related attributes.

## EDA Steps Performed
The following analysis steps were completed:

1. Loaded the dataset using pandas.
2. Inspected column names, data types, and summary statistics.
3. Cleaned and converted numerical fields where necessary.
4. Visualized the distribution of house prices using histograms.
5. Explored relationships between price and other variables using scatter plots.
6. Analyzed average prices across different locations.
7. Generated a correlation matrix for numerical features.

## Key Insights
- House prices vary significantly depending on the location.
- Numerical variables such as carpet area and bathrooms show limited direct correlation with price.
- This suggests that categorical features may play an important role in determining property value.

## Tools & Libraries
- Python
- Pandas
- Matplotlib
- Seaborn
- Jupyter Notebook

## Conclusion
EDA helped in understanding the dataset and identifying important patterns and relationships between variables.  
The analysis provides a strong foundation for further predictive modeling if needed.
